combinatorical problem, no need for program.

We are talking about a multiset S such that

	S = {20 * D, 20 * R}

where D is a down movement and R is a right movement.  The solution to the
problem is the number of permutation of that set which is equal to

	n! / n1!n2!

where n = 40 (number of total items) and n1 = n2 = 20 (number of individual
items).  This can be simplified (since there are only two types of objects)
to

	n! / n1!(n - n1!)

or simply

	C(n, n1)

where C is the combination function.

Hence the answer is

	C(40, 20) = 137846528820
